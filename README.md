 My Learning Journey: From Zero Knowledge to Aspiring Data Analyst and Developer

### **The Beginning**

In March of 2024, I made a decision to change my life. I started a learning journey into data science and development. With zero prior knowledge, no formal education in technology, and no guide except a burning desire to learn, I dove headfirst into the trenches. It has been challenging and thrilling.

### **The Challenges**

Starting from scratch is never easy. I had to learn concepts that seemed alien at first: algorithms, coding syntax, data wrangling, and the sheer complexity of the tools professionals use daily. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed, stuck on problems that seemed insurmountable, and doubted my ability to continue.

One thing I have always told myself is that you can't beat someone who won't quit. I leaned into resources like online courses, GitHub repositories, and forums. I built projects, some of which were messy and incomplete, but they were mine. With every line of code, I chipped away at the mountain of knowledge, gaining confidence as I went. The joy of creation over consumption made every painful night of reading documentation and debugging endless lines makes it worth it.

### **Building Projects and Skills**

Fast forward to now, and I’ve created a substantial collection of projects, each one a testament to my growth. From portfolio projects like customer segmentation and logistics optimization to a comprehensive accident reporting application, I’ve tackled challenges that stretched my abilities and demonstrated real-world impact.

I even wiped my entire laptop on accident and then started fresh on Arch Linux, committing to mastering environments and tools I thought were beyond my reach. Every mistake, every bug, every triumph brought me closer to understanding what it takes to build something meaningful.

### **Why I’m Starting a Blog**

Looking back, I wish I had started documenting my journey earlier. Sharing my struggles, solutions, and successes could have engaged others, helped me reflect, and perhaps even inspired someone else.

But it’s never too late. This blog marks the start of my effort to engage with the community, share my learning process, and build connections. I hope my journey resonates with others who are on similar paths or inspires those considering a leap into this field.

### **What’s Next?**

Moving forward, I’ll use this outlet to:

- Share the lessons I’ve learned from tackling real-world projects.

- Provide tutorials and insights on tools like Docker, PostgreSQL, and data visualization frameworks.

- Document my efforts to refine and deploy my flagship project, Risk Ranger.

- Reflect on the challenges and triumphs of transitioning into a tech career.

I want to hear from others in the community, learn from your experiences, and build a network of individuals who support and inspire each other.

### **Join Me on This Journey**

The whole idea of a career in tech feels daunting and uncertain. I should have started down this path years ago, because the passion and joy is here. I'm not as far along as I'd like to be in under a year, but I am giving it my all. This journey has been about more than just learning to code—it’s been about resilience, curiosity, and the incredible power of community. Let’s keep pushing forward together.
